Inventory and Patch Management 

This is the process of tracking and maintaining an up-to-date list of all hardware and software assets within an organisation while regularly applying security patches and updates. It's important for cybersecurity as it helps identify vulnerabilities and ensures they are promptly patched, reducing the risk of security breaches and system vulnerabilities.

Inventory and Patch Management contributes to operational excellence by enhancing system reliability and security. It minimises downtime due to vulnerabilities and helps maintain consistent performance, ultimately leading to more efficient and reliable operations.

Inventory and Patch Management is often listed under operational excellence because it directly impacts the efficiency and reliability of an organisationâ€™s IT operations. While it is critical for security, it's also about ensuring that systems operate smoothly, reducing operational disruptions caused by vulnerabilities and patches. In essence, it supports both security and operational excellence objectives.
