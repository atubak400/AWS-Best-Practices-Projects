# Operational Excellence in AWS Infrastructure

In order to improve the operational excellence of your AWS infrastructure, we need to strengthen our:

- Inventory and Patch Management
- Automating operations with Playbooks and Runbooks 

## A. Inventory and Patch Management

Inventory and Patch Management is the process of tracking and maintaining an up-to-date list of all hardware and software assets within an organization while regularly applying security patches and updates. It's important for cybersecurity as it helps identify vulnerabilities and ensures they are promptly patched, reducing the risk of security breaches and system vulnerabilities.

Inventory and Patch Management contributes to operational excellence by enhancing system reliability and security. It minimizes downtime due to vulnerabilities and helps maintain consistent performance, ultimately leading to more efficient and reliable operations.

Inventory and Patch Management is often listed under operational excellence because it directly impacts the efficiency and reliability of an organization's IT operations. While it is critical for security, it's also about ensuring that systems operate smoothly, reducing operational disruptions caused by vulnerabilities and patches. In essence, it supports both security and operational excellence objectives.

In this first level of our Operational Excellence labs, we'll focus on:

1. CloudFormation
2. Systems Manager
3. Patch Manager
4. Maintenance Windows
5. Simple Notification Service

### CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is a service that provides infrastructure as code (IAC) capabilities for defining, provisioning, and managing AWS resources and their dependencies in a declarative template format. It allows users to create, update, and delete AWS resources in a consistent and automated manner, enabling infrastructure provisioning and management to be version-controlled and repeatable. We will be using it to deploy our environment.

### Systems Manager

AWS Systems Manager is a service that helps you manage and automate operational tasks on your AWS resources, such as patch management, configuration management, and instance management, providing a unified interface for these tasks. It simplifies resource management, improves security compliance, and allows you to efficiently maintain and monitor your infrastructure in AWS. We will be using it for inventory management.

### Patch Manager

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a service that helps automate the process of patching and managing software on AWS instances. It allows you to schedule and apply patches to your Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises servers, and other supported AWS resource types to maintain security and compliance. Patch Manager simplifies the task of keeping your systems up to date with the latest patches and updates, reducing vulnerabilities and improving overall system stability. We will be using it for patch management.

### Maintenance Windows

AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows is a service that enables you to schedule and automate the execution of administrative and maintenance tasks on your AWS resources. It allows you to define a window of time during which you can perform tasks such as applying patches, running automation scripts, or performing other routine maintenance activities on multiple instances or resources in a controlled and organized manner. Maintenance Windows help you ensure that these tasks are carried out efficiently and with minimal disruption to your operations, especially in large-scale and complex AWS environments. We will be using it to configure a maintenance window.

### Simple Notification Service

An SNS (Simple Notification Service) Topic is a communication channel or endpoint in AWS that allows you to send messages or notifications to multiple subscribers. Subscribers can be various AWS services, such as Lambda functions, SQS queues, or HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, as well as external endpoints like email addresses or SMS numbers. SNS Topics facilitate the distribution of messages and notifications across different parts of your AWS infrastructure or to external systems, making it a versatile tool for event-driven and pub-sub (publish-subscribe) communication.
